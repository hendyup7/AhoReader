"Will you leave everything behind and go on a journey with me?"

I wonder how many people could answer such a question right away.

But whatever their number might be, I could.

The scene that day is still indelibly engraved in my memory like a photograph.

"Will you leave everything behind and go on a journey with me?"

My answer was "Yes".
