When I woke up, the first thing I felt was my eyes being dazzled.

Light filled my vision, and I narrowed my eyes in discomfort.

Once my eyes adjusted to the brightness, I found a young blonde woman gazing at me.

A beautiful girl...... No, a beautiful woman would be more appropriate.

(Who is it?)

Beside her was a man of a similar young age with brown hair, giving me a stiff smile.

A strong and arrogant looking man. His muscles were amazing.

Brown hair, arrogant type. Looking at his DQN[1] appearance, I should have been repulsed. Strangely enough though, I did not feel he was unpleasant.

His hair was a pretty brown color, probably because it wasn't dyed, I guess.

"-----XX-----XXXX"

The woman cracked a smile as she watched me and said something.

What is she saying? Feeling fuzzy, I could not hear clearly and didn't understand it at all.

Could it be that it's not Japanese?

"------XXXXX----XXX," the man replied with a gentle expression. Really, what did he just say? I couldn't understand it at all.

"------XX-----XXX"

A third person's voice came from somewhere.

I couldn't see them.

I tried to sit up and ask them, "Where is this place, and who are you guys?"

Even if I was a hikikomori, I still wasn't a complete failure at communication.

I could still do something like this.


"Ah, Ah------"


But I couldn't tell if what came from my lips was a groan or just heavy breathing.

My body couldn't move.

I felt sensations in my fingers and wrists, but I couldn't move my upper body.

"XXX--XXXXX"

In the end, the man carried me up.

This is a joke, right? My body weighs over 100 kilograms, and he lifts it up so eas....

No, maybe I had been in a coma for dozens of days, and it caused my body weight to go down.

It was such a huge incident. There was a large possibility that I lost an arm or a leg.

(A fate worse than death, hah......)

On that day.

Those were my thoughts.
