A month passed by.

It looked like I was reincarnated. I finally realized that fact.

I had become a baby.

I confirmed it when I was carried up with my head supported and my own body appeared in my sight.

I didn't know why I still had my past memories, but there was nothing bad about retaining them.

Retaining memories upon reincarnation-----anyone would have entertained such delusions at least once.

But I didn't think that such a delusion would become reality......

The first couple I had seen when I opened my eyes seemed to be my parents.

They were probably in the earlier half of their 20s.

Clearly, they were younger than me in my past life.

From the perspective of a 34-year-old, it was alright to call them young.

It really made me envious that they had children at that age.

I already noticed it from the start, but I didn't seem to be in Japan.

The language was different, my parents' faces didn't appear to be Japanese, and their clothes even seemed to be that of a native village.

I couldn't see anything resembling an electronic device (the person who wore a maid's apron was cleaning with a cloth), and the utensils, bowls, and furniture were coarsely made from wood. It was probably not an advanced, developed country.

The light was not produced light bulbs, but from candles and lamps.

Of course, there was the possibility of them being very poor and unable to afford the electricity bills.

.....Maybe that possibility was very high?

I thought they surely had some money, as there was someone dressed like a maid.

But it wouldn't be strange if it was a sister of one of my parents. It would be a normal thing for her to be cleaning.

I certainly wanted to start afresh, but living in a family that could not even afford to pay the bills made me very restless.
